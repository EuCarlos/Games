# Games
This repository is a set of 3 games that are being developed in HTML 5 and Javascript by the GDevelop 5 tool. The **Airplane Shot** files are not available in the repository because it is full of bugs and it was just a sprite change to test animations and movement. The **LABIRINTO** files are available in the `Labirinto` directory to access the game locally look for the `index.html` file. And the **Moto RunPix** files are in the `Moto RunPix` with local access `.index.html`

**OBS.:** Below are available the game executables in `.exe` format and links to play online.

</p>
Airplane Shots it's the first game I developed in GDevelop 5, as it's the first I just took a set of examples and assembled the sprites. For this reason the game is short and with some bugs. The objective of the game is to beat the boss, for that use the arrow keys to move, spacebar to launch shots and press CHANGE to change the attack power.
